 1)	What is SQL and what is it used for?

	SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage and manipulate relational 		databases. It is used to insert, update, and retrieve data from a database.

 2) What are the types of SQL commands?
	
    DDL (Data Definition Language) commands are used to define and modify the structure of a database. 			Examples include CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE.
	DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands are used to manipulate the data in a database. Examples 			include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
	DCL (Data Control Language) commands are used to control the access and security of a database. 			Examples include GRANT and REVOKE.

 3) What is a database schema?
	
	A database schema is a blueprint of the structure of a database. It defines the tables, columns, 		relationships, and constraints of a database.

 4) What is a primary key?

	A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the 		table. It is used to enforce the entity integrity constraint and ensure that no two rows in the 		table are identical.

 5) What is a foreign key?

	A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another 		table. It is used to enforce the referential integrity constraint and ensure that the data in the 		table is consistent with the data in the referenced table.

 6) What is a join?

 	A join is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. There 	are different types of joins, including INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.

 7) What is a subquery?

	A subquery is a query that is nested inside another query. It is used to retrieve data that will be 	used in the main query's WHERE clause or SELECT list.
 
 8) What is normalization?

	Normalization is a process of organizing a database to minimize redundancy and dependency. It 			involves breaking up large tables into smaller ones, and ensuring that each table only contains data 	that is related to a single topic.

 9) What is an index?

	An index is a data structure that is used to improve the performance of queries on large tables. It 	provides a fast way to look up data based on the values in one or more columns.

 10) What is a transaction?

	A transaction is a sequence of SQL statements that are executed as a single unit of work. It ensures 	that all statements are executed successfully, or none are executed at all. This helps to maintain 		the integrity of the database.

 11) Primary Key vs Foreign Key?
	
	In a database, a primary key is a unique identifier for a row or record in a table. It ensures that 	each row in the table can be uniquely identified, and it must have a unique value for each record. 		In other words, a primary key uniquely identifies a specific row in a table.

	For example, in the "student" table of your database, the "RollNo" column is the primary key. This 		means that each row in the "student" table can be uniquely identified by its RollNo value.

	A foreign key, on the other hand, is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another 	table. It is used to establish a relationship between two tables, where one table has a reference to 	another table's primary key.

	For example, in the "enrollment" table of your database, the "Sid" column is a foreign key that 		refers to the "Sid" column of the "society" table. This means that the "Sid" column in the 	"enrollment" table references the "Sid" column in the "society" table, creating a relationship 			between the two tables. This allows the "enrollment" table to reference a specific row in the 	"society" table.

 12) What is Constraint?

	 In a database, a constraint is a rule that is defined to maintain the integrity, accuracy, and 		consistency of the data stored in the database. Constraints can be applied to tables to enforce 		certain rules or requirements for the data.

	In the SQL language, you can use the CONSTRAINT keyword to define a constraint for a table. When 		defining a constraint, you can also give it a name using the CONSTRAINT name syntax. Giving a name 		to a constraint is not compulsory, but it can be helpful in identifying and managing constraints in 	the future.

	For example, in the enrollment table we created earlier, we defined three constraints: pk3, fk1, and 	fk2. pk3 is a primary key constraint, and fk1 and fk2 are foreign key constraints. We named each 		constraint to make them more easily identifiable in the future.
